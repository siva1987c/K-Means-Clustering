K-Means-Clustering
==================

Perform clustering on traffic patterns of restaurants

This was a homework assignment for my Information Storage and Retreival class.  By using daily (every hour) and weekly traffic patterns of restaurants (traffic_patterns.txt), create from 2 to 21 clusters of the restaurants.  Then evaluate those clusters by calculating the purity as compared to the golden standard clusters ('ground_truth_clusters.txt').  Also calculate Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) as compared to the golden standard clusters.  The purity and nmi scores are written out to a file named 'data.txt'.
